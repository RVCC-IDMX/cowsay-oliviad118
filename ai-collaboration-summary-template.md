# AI collaboration summary

**Student name:** Olivia Denton

**Assignment:** Week 2 - Use Agent mode

**Expected time:** About 15 minutes to complete this reflection

## Key interactions

Review your chat history with Agent and document 2 meaningful interactions—ones where you learned something new or had to adjust your prompt.

### Interaction 1: [Brief title, e.g., "Setting up npm with Agent"]

**My prompt:**

> Initialize a new npm project and install cowsay.

**What happened:**

[What did Agent do? What did you learn?]

It did exactly what the prompt asked. Helped me to install and setup to use the terminal and cowsay.

---

### Interaction 2: A little explanation goes a long way

**My prompt:**

> Explain

**What happened:**

[What did Agent do? What did you learn?]

It explained npx cowsay Hello as well as what npx means, breaking down npx cowsay Hello, the ASCII art output, why it worked, and terminal prompts I saw. Gave me a better understanding of what every thing mean while showing me how to properly execute the commands.

---

## Documentation you created

### docs/tutorial-package-json.md

[1-2 sentences about what this file explains and whether you edited Agent's output]

It's about understanding what the package does and is used for. It explains how everything works , what it means and why it matters. Shows what happens if errors happens.

---

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

### Agent mode for setup (required)

[How was using Agent for npm setup different from typing commands yourself? What are the advantages? Any downsides?]

I don't believe there is any downsides to Agent. When I asked for help I got assistance as if I was asking a teacher. I also asked it to explain steps, reasons and the sorts because I not only wanted to see what to do I want to understand why. Its different because you have a built in guide where as me not being 100 percent sure how to start npm setup.

### What you learned (required)

[What was the most useful thing you learned in this assignment? This could be about npm, Agent mode, documentation, or anything else.]

I appreciated learning about asking agent to explain. It gave me an essential project information list/explanation where it broke down every line of code in the package.json. This really helped me understand what I was looking at and makes it remember overtime what's what.

### Optional questions

Answer any of these that interest you:

- Did you use /explain to understand package.json or terminal output? Was it helpful?
- Did you try asking Agent to write commit messages?
Yes I did I just find it easier and more elegantly worded when Agent does it.
- How did they compare to your own?
- What npm concepts would you like to learn more about?
