## Documentation you created

### docs/tutorial-package-json.md

It's about understanding what the package does and is used for. It explains how everything works, what it means and why it matters. Shows what happens if errors happens.

## Reflection

### Agent mode for setup (required)

I don't believe there is any downsides to Agent. When I asked for help I got assistance as if I was asking a teacher. I also asked it to explain steps, reasons and the sorts because I not only wanted to see what to do I want to understand why. Its different because you have a built in guide where as me not being 100 percent sure how to start npm setup.

### What you learned (required)

I appreciated learning about asking agent to explain. It gave me an essential project information list/explanation where it broke down every line of code in the package.json. This really helped me understand what I was looking at and makes it remember overtime what's what.

### Optional questions

- Did you use /explain to understand package.json or terminal output? Was it helpful?
- Did you try asking Agent to write commit messages?

Yes I did I just find it easier and more elegantly worded when Agent does it.

- What npm concepts would you like to learn more about?
